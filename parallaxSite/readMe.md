# Notes:

Webpage best appears on 1400px x 820px or larger view.

Webpage statically starts out in dark mode.

# Known issues with webpage:

When clicking on a navbar link, in-between links will briefly show as active while the webpage is transporting to the clicked section. I attempted to fix this with a setTimeout command although it created
latency when scrolling through the webpage because the active link was behind.

Webpage appears poor quality on mobile view due to large navbar.

In browser console, warning appears regarding scroll-based positioning. I have not experienced any issues from a consumer perspective caused by this.

#myBtn and toggle light/dark mode button do not change colors based on chosen mode.
